## This is the intermediate result without APL!
This Alexa-Skill is developed from the Amazon template for the Node.js JS Quiz Skill (https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-quiz-game) 
A fork of the original is possible under the link above or in Alexa CLI with 
--ask new -> Quiz Select template

In the skill you have the possibility to ask Alexa a question about the World Cup since 1962, or to play the quiz.
The quiz opens with "Play the game".
