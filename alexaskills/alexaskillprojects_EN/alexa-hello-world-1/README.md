## this is the undeveloped version of the skill
This Alexa example skill is a template for a Hello World skill.
First of all Alexa greets a person, where we indicate the name of the person beforehand. On sentences like 
- _"Alexa, say hello to {PersonName}."_
Alexa should react with
- _"Hello, {PersonName}, good day"_

The skill is then developed by fetching a quote from Chuck Norris from an API at runtime and incorporating it in the greeting.
This skill is not an APL skill!
