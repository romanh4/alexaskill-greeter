![Alexa Skills develop manual](http://smart-home-system.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/quiz-skill.jpg "Alexa Example Skill")

## This is the finished developed version!
This Alexa Skill is developed from the Amazon template for the Node.js JS Quiz Skill (https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-quiz-game) 
A fork of the original is possible under the link above or in Alexa CLI with 
--ask new -> Quiz Select template

In the skill you have the possibility to ask Alexa a question about the World Cup since 1962, or to play the quiz.
The quiz opens with "Play the game".

# The not developed original version of the skill can be found at
[alexa-quiz-1 on Github](https://github.com/romanh4/alexaskillprojects/tree/master/alexaskillprojects_EN/alexa-quiz-1/ "alexa-quiz-1 on Github")

The test cases can be executed with Testflow (file Testflow.js), where you can adjust the intents to be tested under /dialogs. More about Testflow at 
[the Github page of Testflow](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-cookbook/tree/master/tools/TestFlow)
This file is a fork of it.
